# ❤️ Heart Failure Prediction Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📘 Overview
This project aims to **predict the occurrence of a heart failure event** based on various medical factors using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm.  
It helps identify patients at higher risk, supporting early diagnosis and better healthcare decisions.

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset contains clinical records of heart failure patients.  
- **Features include:**  
  - Age  
  - Anaemia  
  - Creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels  
  - Diabetes  
  - Ejection fraction  
  - High blood pressure  
  - Platelets  
  - Serum creatinine and sodium levels  
  - Smoking habits  
  - Time (follow-up period)  
- **Target Variable:** Heart failure event (1 = occurred, 0 = not occurred)

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** — used for binary classification to separate patients with and without heart failure risk.

## ⚙️ Steps Involved
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Handle missing values and normalize the data  
3. Split dataset into training and testing sets  
4. Train the **SVM model** using a suitable kernel (e.g., RBF)  
5. Evaluate model using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **ROC curve**  

## 📈 Results
- The SVM model effectively predicts the likelihood of heart failure events.  
- Provides interpretable insights into key medical risk factors.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## 💡 Key Insight
Support Vector Machine provides robust predictions for heart failure risk, making it a useful model for healthcare data analysis.
